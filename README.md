# Building a Rule-Based Chatbot with Natural Language Processing
A rule-based chatbot follows a set of predefined rules or patterns to match user input and generate an appropriate response. The chatbot can’t understand or process input beyond these rules and relies on exact matches making it ideal for handling repetitive tasks or specific queries.

- Pattern Matching: The chatbot compares the user’s input with predefined patterns and selects a matching response.
- Predictable Responses: Since the chatbot operates based on a defined set of rules it provides predictable and consistent responses.
- Limited Flexibility: Rule-based chatbots are not designed to handle complex conversations or evolve over time like AI-based chatbots. They work best for situations where user input can be anticipated.
